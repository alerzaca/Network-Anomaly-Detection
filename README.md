# Network Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Originally developed as a group project for the university course "Wykrywanie Anomalii Sieciowych z UÅ¼yciem Uczenia Maszynowego" (Network Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning), this fork aims to further develop and refine the original project. Educational purposes only.

## Datasets

The datasets used for this project include publicly available network traffic data, such as:
- [CIC-IDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)
- [CSE-CIC-IDS2018](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html) (downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solarmainframe/ids-intrusion-csv?resource=download))

## Models
The project includes implementations of several machine learning algorithms:
- Random Forest
- Isolation Forest
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (Autoencoder, Multilayer Perceptron)
