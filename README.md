# Network Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms

Originally developed as a group project for the university course "Wykrywanie Anomalii Sieciowych z UÅ¼yciem Uczenia Maszynowego" (Network Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning), this fork aims to further develop and refine the original project. Educational purposes only.

## Datasets

The dataset used for this project is the publicly available [CIC-IDS2017](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html) network traffic dataset. Alternatively, the [CSE-CIC-IDS2018](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html) can also be used, but preprocessing this dataset together requires more than 30 GB of RAM.

## Models
The project includes implementations of several machine learning algorithms:
- Random Forest (also used for Feature Selection)
- Isolation Forest
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks (Autoencoder, Multilayer Perceptron)
